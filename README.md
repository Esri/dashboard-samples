# dashboard-samples

Using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, you can develop widget, map tools, and feature action extensions for Operations Dashboard running on Windows and in a browser.

![Operations Dashboard with extensions](https://github.com/Esri/dashboard-samples/blob/master/operations-dashboard-extensibility.png)

## Features
* Buffer map tool - A map tool that creates buffers from a clicked point.
* Elevation Profile widget - A widget that creates profile graphs by drawing lines interactively on the map.
* Export to CSV feature action - A feature action that exports the feature results into a CSV table.
* GeoEnrichment widget - A widget that displays an age pyramid from a clicked point.
* Line Chart widget - A line chart widget that is powered by data from your map or external data source.
* List widget - A custom list widget.
* Open browser tab feature action - A feature action that opens a web page on a new browser tab.
* Scatter plot widget - A widget that shows a scatter plot based on the selected fields of a data source.
* Table widget - A widget that shows the attributes of the features from a data source on a grid.
* Table widget with config - A widget that shows the attributes of the features based on the selected fields from a data source.

## Requirements
* [Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/opsdashboard/OperationsDashboard.application)
* Your favorite IDE
* Web browser with access to the Internet

## Resources
* Read our developer guide [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/operations-dashboard-extensibility-overview.html).
* Read our API reference [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/datasourceproxy-amd.html).

## Instructions - How to write a sample

 1. Create a folder for your sample.
 2. In the sample folder, you should have at minimum a JSON manifest file and a HTML file. Use HTML5 for your HTML file.
 3. You can also create a JS file with the business logic for the extension.
 4. Copy the following blueprint into your sample manifest file, update the properties and remove the unnecessary properties. Read the [manifest](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/operations-dashboard-extensibility-create-ext-manifest.html) topic to learn more:
 
  ```
  {
    "type": <Type of sample: Widget, Map Tool, Feature Action>,
    "name": <A nice name>,
    "description": <A nice description>,
    "useDataFromView": <true|false>,
    "usePortalServices": <true|false>
    "runtime" : {
     "path": <The relative path of the runtime web page (the path from under the sample folder)>,
     "iconPath": <The relative path of the icon representing the sample (the path from under the sample folder)>,
    },
    "configuration": {
     “path": <The relative path of the configuration web page (the path from under the sample folder)>,
     "requiresDataSource": <true|false>,
     "requiresMapWidget": <true|false>,
     "supportFeatureActions": <true|false>
    },
    "credits": "Esri, http://www.esri.com"
  }
  ```
 
 5. Copy the following blueprint into your sample html file:
 
  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head lang="en">
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title></title>
  
    <!-- Add your sample style here -->
  
  </head>
  
  <!-- Add your sample configuration or runtime html here -->
  <!-- You can also use Dijit -->
  
  <script>
    var extensionLocation = location.pathname.replace(/\/[^/]+$/, '');
    var dojoConfig = {
      async: true, // Anything is async from now on
      locale: location.search.match(/locale=([\w\-]+)/) ? RegExp.$1 : "en-us", // The locale of the Operations Dashboard
      host application is passed by url query params
      paths: {
        "extension": extensionLocation
      }
    };
  </script>
  <script src="//js.arcgis.com/3.17"></script>
  <script>
    require([
      "dojo/parser",
      "dojo/domReady!"
    ], function(parser){
      parser.parse();
    });
  </script>
  <!-- Add you additional javascript scripts here-->
  
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

 6. If your sample requires configuration, create an additional HTML file. Also you can create a JS file for the
 configuration's business logic. Make sure your manifest file contains the properties for the configuration.
 7. To test your sample,
 [start Operations Dashboard in developer mode](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/operations-dashboard-extensibility-getstarted-setup-dev-env.html),
 then create a single-display operation view and add the extension. If you create a multi-display operation view, you can only open it in the
 Windows app, and you won't be able to debug your extension in the web browser.
 8. You can use the [extension debugger](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/operations-dashboard-extensibility-test-debug.html)
 to debug your sample in the Windows app.
